### Abstract

CodeRefinery is a project which supports students and researchers across all
academic disciplines by advancing the FAIRness of research software and
development practices so that they can collaboratively develop, review,
discuss, test, share, and reuse their codes. This initiative teaches which
software is needed but is often missed in a traditional university curriculum.
Thus far, over 1500 researchers from the Nordic countries have been trained,
and with the received follow-up funding, the plan is to turn this project into
a sustainable organization reaching beyond the Nordics. During this
presentation, we will touch upon the knowledge that was acquired as well as the
focus of the collaborative co-teaching approach to reach 100 participants per
event. Furthermore, the plans of the CodeRefinery project and its support will
be discussed.
